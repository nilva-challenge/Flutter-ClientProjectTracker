# In name of Allah
This project is to track & organize clients' requested projects. 

## Introduction 
Every client needs to be aware of the status & progress of project when he/she requests a service to be done for him/her. So, to address this need, we want to give full clarity over projects' status to clients.

In this project we want a flutter client application to get client's credentials & show him/her a list of the projects he/she has. Also, the detail of each project should be available to client.

## Sections
We will have 3 main pages (or sections).

### first section
Authentication will be our first setpoint, this page will be seperated into two parts:
- first, the username part: The user will see a brief description & at the end of page a username field, also there must be a **next** button at the top of page for ease of navigation.
- second, the password part: The user will see another brief description & at the end of page a password field, also there must be a **previous** button & a **submit** button at the top of page for ease of navigation.

### second section
The second & foremost section is the main page, this page is consisted of client detail, project list, bottom navigation.
Also, each item in project list will have following detail:
- project name
- project progress 
- project next deadline
- a notification badge

### third section
The last section is project detail page, this page shows an overall detail of project, then a list of key-values which will be dynamically got from server, then the charts to report to client, and finally the phases list (every phase has a basic structure which will be throughly explained.

## Expectations
So What does matter to us?

- a clean structure of codebase
- clean code practices
- getting familiar with state management practices & patterns
- finally & most important, ability to learn (this project is primarily a test to see how you can learn the things you do not know, so don't be afraid if you don't know a subject, that is our goal)
